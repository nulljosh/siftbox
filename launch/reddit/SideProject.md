## Title
I built a tool that reads your inbox and clears junk mail in one tap

## Body

My inbox fills up the same way every day: real mail mixed in with junk that outnumbers it ten to one. Filter rules only catch what you already know to catch, and most triage tools want a login of their own and a place to sit between you and your mail forever.

So I built Siftbox. Sign in with Google (or an iCloud app-specific password) and it reads your actual inbox over the Gmail API or IMAP. Every message gets scored before anything is touched: sender/display-name mismatch, urgency language, an unsubscribe header from someone you don't recognize, a reply-to domain that doesn't match the sender. Two or more signals confirms junk, one alone is too easy for a real sender to trip by accident.

Most bulk senders already support RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe, so it POSTs to that directly instead of making you open a browser. Archive, delete, or unsubscribe are each one tap, nothing happens on its own. It's a Cloudflare Worker backend, web app plus iOS/macOS wrappers.

It's free right now, no paid tier exists. Would love feedback, especially on false positives where it flags a real sender.
